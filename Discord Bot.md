# Title:
Quality-of-Student-Life Bot

# Introduction/ Context/ Innovation:
Everyone has their own preferred means of communication and organization. As a student, we need to keep track of events, classes, emails, exams. As such, we intend to offer a simplified means to do that using a platform that a big part of us students already use: Discord.
We propose creating a discord bot to handle many of the above tasks allowing students to centralize their information and have it at a moment's notice.

# Goals / Foreseen challenges to overcome:
Develop a methodology to fetch the relevant data
Allow people to insert their data and personalize their "profile".
Notify or serve people with the information upon request
Friend people to get conditional access to their schedule

# Innovative aspects of work:
Usage of a widespread platform as the basis for the quality of life tool.
Social-media like interactions between people


# Involved technologies
Discord as a overall platform
Packages for bot creation (probably Javascript or Python)
API for data fetching

# Expected results
A student should be able to subscribe to a set of curricular units in order to get updates on the schedule, set up their email so that they have a "discord-inbox", friend other people to have access to their schedule, set up their own events.

# Foreseen plan
Creation of a simple bot
Adding student profiles and store the data
Fetch data from the API
Incrementally add features for the user
Add features for interaction between students
Integration and testing
